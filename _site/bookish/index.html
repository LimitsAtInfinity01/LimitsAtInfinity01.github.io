            <div class="answer">
                <h3>Languages and technologies</h3>
                <p>
                    Bookish was written in Python, and the Django framework was used to develop the backend. The Django ORM was utilized to interact with the database, enabling efficient and seamless data management. 
                    The frontend was built using HTML and CSS, ensuring a responsive and user-friendly interface. Additionally, the application integrates with the Open Library API to fetch book data and metadata.
                    Django's templating engine was used to dynamically generate HTML pages, allowing for seamless integration of backend data with the frontend. 
                    This made it easier to create reusable components and maintain a consistent design across the application.
                </p>
                <h3>Authentication & Media:</h3>
                <p>
                        Bookish leverages Django's built-in authentication system to provide secure user login, logout, and registration functionalities. 
                        This ensures that user data is protected and access to features is personalized. 
                        Additionally, the application supports file uploads for user avatars and media posts (images and videos) using Django's FileSystemStorage. 
                        This allows users to customize their profiles and share rich media content seamlessly.

                    Bookish is a work in progress that requires improvements in several areas, such as implementing an API wrapper for enhanced search functionality and performance.
