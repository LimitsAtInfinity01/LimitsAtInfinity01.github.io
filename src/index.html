                    <p>
                        Hello! I'm Leonardo Alferez, an academic librarian with a passion for coding. I have successfully taught myself Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript 
                        to the point that I can develop web applications and write python programs.
                        <br>
                        <br> 
                        Right now, I am developing a full stack web application using Django called <span style="font-weight: bolder;">Bookish</span>,
                        which is best described as a social media platform for book lovers.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Other technologies that I love learning are game develompent with Godot and GDscript.

        <h2 class="section-subtitle">Skills</h2>
        <p>
            As a librarian I have aquired and developed many skills that have helped me succeed in my career. Skills such as reference service librarian
            make me support students in the academic research and thus their success. Participating in committees and collavorating with other librarians, faculty and staff have increased my 
            interpesonal skills greatly. Providing library instructions to college students have also make my speech and public speaking better as well as my presentation abilities.
            <br>
            <br>
            A love for learning keeps me motivated to pursue my interests and thus learn more skills. That is why I decided to learn to code, web and game develompent after finishing graduate school. 
            While there is a lot to learn and it feels like I will never finish, I know I can do it and have a fun while doing it.
